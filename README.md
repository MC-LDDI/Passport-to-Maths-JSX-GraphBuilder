# Passport-to-Maths-JSX-GraphBuilder

## Project Description
The Passport to Maths: JSX GraphBuilder application was developed by the Learning Design and Digital Innovation team at Monash College in Melbourne, Australia, as part of a project to create a suite of online asynchronous mathematics learning modules. The program facilitates student success by providing a personalised program of learning. We are releasing the code for the Passport to Maths: JSX GraphBuilder to allow other learning design teams to benefit from this innovation. 
This project is a user-friendly web application designed to simplify the process of creating and customising mathematical graphs for non-technical users. The application provides a straightforward interface where users can input values, which are then used to generate and display mathematical graphs. This functionality is made possible through the use of the JSXGraph library. 

## Use of JSXGraph
This project utilises the JSXGraph library to provide the core functionality for creating customised mathematical graphs. We have developed a tool on top of JSXGraph that allows non-technical users to easily generate and manipulate graphs through a user-friendly interface.
JSXGraph is an independent library maintained by the Mathematical Institute at the University of Bayreuth and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Our tool simply extends the capabilities of JSXGraph to make graph creation accessible to everyone. More details about JSXGraph can be found at https://jsxgraph.org.

## How to Use
### 1. Download or Clone the Repository:
Download the project files as a ZIP or clone the repository using  `git clone`.
### 2. Open the Application:
Navigate to the project directory and open index.html in your web browser.
### 3. Using the Graph Builder:
The **Passport-to-Maths-JSX-GraphBuilder** allows you to create graphs for up to **five different f(x) equations, as well as circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, and piecewise functions**.
Enter the appropriate values following the instructions provided on the page. Ensure that you input values in the correct format.
You can use the **JavaScript Math object** to perform mathematical operations (e.g., Math.PI for Ï€, Math.log() for logarithms).
### 4. Start Graphing:
After entering your equations and values, the graphs will be dynamically generated and displayed on the page.
